# Zotify in Google Colaboratory
A notebook that downloads music and podcasts to your Google Drive.
## Usage
## F.A.Q.
### Will my account get banned if I use this tool?

~~~~
Use Zotify at your own risk, the developers of Zotify are not responsible if your account gets banned.

Currently no user has reported their account getting banned after using Zotify.

We highly recommend using Zotify with a burner account.
Alternatively, there is a configuration option labeled ```DOWNLOAD_REAL_TIME```, this limits the download speed to the duration of the song being downloaded thus not appearing suspicious.
This option is much slower and is only recommended for premium users who wish to download songs in high quality without buying premium on a burner account.

### What do I do if I see "Your session has been terminated"?

Don't worry, just try logging back in.
Since 2018 Spotify started to randomize new accounts username, please try again with your email instead.
